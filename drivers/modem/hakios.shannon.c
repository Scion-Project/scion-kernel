 * The cellular modem of the Galaxy S9 (starlte, SM-G960F): the Samsung "Shannon" CP that is part of the Exynos 9810
 * itself (Samsung's driver calls it ss360ap). Only with boot-arg cp=N on this phone; with cp absent or 0 nothing
 * below runs: no register is read, no memory mapped, no call made to the secure world.
 *
 * WHAT THE CP IS, AS THE AP SEES IT (the phone's device tree and Samsung's kernel, read as data)
 *   its memory     146 MB of the phone's DRAM at 0xF0000000 (the device tree's reserved "modem_if"), outside XNU's
 *                  RAM. The CP sees it at 0x40000000. The image's own table (below) divides it:
 *                    0x0000000  the CP's code and data, 121 MB (BOOT at 0, MAIN at 0x10000, NV at 0x4900000)
 *                    0x7900000  VSS, the voice processor's, 7 MB
 *                    0x8000000  IPC, 5 MB: the memory both sides talk through
 *                    0x8500000  ZMC, 11 MB: downlink packets' buffers (not used here)
 *                    0x9000000  VPA, 2 MB
 *   its image      the phone's RADIO partition, read only, used exactly as it is. It starts with a table of
 *                  contents of 32-byte entries (name[12], offset in the partition, address for the CP, size, CRC-32,
 *                  number): TOC, BOOT, MAIN, VSS, NV, OFFSET. An entry goes to (its address - BOOT's address) in the
 *                  CP's memory. NV has no bytes in RADIO: it is the place of the phone's own non-volatile data
 *                  (Android's boot daemon copies /efs/nv_data.bin there). This driver never writes the EFS partition
 *                  and never mounts it. With cp_nv=2 (the owner's decision of 13 Nov 2026) it READS /nv_data.bin out
 *                  of EFS at boot through a read-only ext4 reader (hakios.ext4ro.h over hakios_ufs_read_partition,
 *                  which has no write path), keeps it in RAM for the run and gives it to the CP; only its size and a
 *                  CRC prefix are logged. With cp_nv=1 it takes a file "nv_data.bin" that the boot image's builder
 *                  put beside the kernel (hakios_image_file("fw", ...)); without either the place is filled with zeros.
 *   the secure     the image is checked and the CP's memory closed by Samsung's EL3 monitor, not by us:
 *   world          SMC 0x82000700 with x1 = the mode (2: open the memory for loading; 0, or'ed with the memory's
 *                  address when the image carries its memory table: check BOOT and MAIN and lock), x2 = BOOT's size,
 *                  x3 = MAIN's size, each between SMC 0x82001011 x1 = 0 and x1 = 1 (the hash engine's clock on and
 *                  off). Its answer is 0 or one of Samsung's error numbers (smc_error below). If it refuses, this
 *                  driver stops: nothing is patched, skipped or retried another way.
 *   the PMU        0x14060000. CP_CTRL_NS (0x30) and CP_CTRL_S (0x34) belong to the secure world and are read and
 *                  written through the same SMC (x1 = 3 read, with x2 = 0 or 1 for the low and high half, x3 = 0 for
 *                  _S and 1 for _NS; x1 = 4 write, x2 = the value). CP_STAT 0x38, CENTRAL_SEQ_CP_CONFIGURATION 0x280
 *                  and _STATUS 0x284 (bits 23:16: 0x80 while the CP is held in reset), RESET_SEQUENCER_STATUS 0x504
 *                  (bits 2:0: 0 before the CP has ever been powered, 5 when it has), the CP's power-down
 *                  configuration 0x1320-0x1338, CLEANY_BUS_CP 0x3920/0x3924.
 *   AP2CP_CFG      0x14820000 bit 0: EL3 prepares the CP's view of the memory at cold boot; writing 1 here lets the
 *                  CP's processor run.
 *   the mailbox    0x14170000. INTGR1 (0x1C) bit n raises interrupt n at the CP; INTSR0 (0x14) bits 31:16 are the
 *                  CP's interrupts to the AP, cleared through INTCR0 (0x0C) and masked by INTMR0 (0x10); 64 shared
 *                  words ISSRn at 0x80 + 4n. This phone's use: word 0 the AP's message, word 1 the CP's, word 2 the
 *                  AP's state (bit 0 wake lock, 4:1 state, 5 "PDA active", 13:6 the board's revision, 15:14 dual
 *                  SIM), word 3 the CP's state (4:1 state, 5 "LTE active"). Interrupt 0 each way says "word 0/1 has
 *                  a message"; the AP's 1 is "wake up". Read by polling here (the interrupts stay masked).
 *   a message      bit 7 valid; with bit 6 a command in bits 5:0 (1 INIT_START, 2 INIT_END, 8 PHONE_START,
 *                  0xD PIF_INIT_DONE, 7 CRASH_RESET, 9 CRASH_EXIT); without it bit 0 "there is data in the rings".
 *   the IPC        its first words are a magic number and an "access" word, then the old two queues' pointers; the
 *   memory         boot loader of the CP talks through the old "raw" queue (to the CP at 12288, 2084864 bytes;
 *                  from it at 2097152, 2097152 bytes; head and tail words at 24/28 and 32/36) with the magic "BOOT"
 *                  (0x424F4F54). The running CP talks through rings of buffers (Samsung's "SBD"): at 2048 a table
 *                  the AP writes (version, channels, per channel and direction the ring's length, buffer size and
 *                  where its arrays of offsets and sizes are), the rings' read and write counters after it, the
 *                  buffers from 64 KB up; magic 0xAA and access 1 once the link is up.
 *   a frame        Samsung's SIPC5: a byte 0xF8 (bit 2: padded), the channel, the length (16 bits, header included),
 *                  then the message. Channels: 215 the boot loader, 235 the phone's control messages ("FMT"),
 *                  245 the CP's file requests to the AP ("RFS").
 *
 * THE STAGES (cp=N)
 *   1  a look, nothing changed: the PMU's and the mailbox's registers, the two secure words (the SMC's read),
 *      the first words of the CP's memory as the boot loader left it, RADIO's table of contents.
 *   2  that, and the image loaded and checked: the CP's power domain started if it never was (CP_CTRL_NS bit 1,
 *      CP_CTRL_S bit 3), the memory opened (mode 2), BOOT, MAIN and VSS copied from RADIO and compared with the
 *      table's CRCs, the NV place filled (zeros, or the builder's file with cp_nv=1), then the secure world's
 *      check (mode 0). Its answer is logged. The CP is not started.
 *   3  that, and the CP started: the mailbox cleared, the AP's state word set, AP2CP_CFG written, the CP's state
 *      waited for, the boot loader's two questions (0x900D, answer 0xA00D; 0x9F00, answer 0xAF00), then the
 *      running CP's INIT_START, the ring table written, PIF_INIT_DONE, and its PHONE_START: "THE CP IS UP".
 *      It is watched for cp_wait seconds (20) and then put back in reset.
 *   4  that, and the link, ONLY with the phone's own NV data loaded (cp_nv=1): the one command this driver ever
 *      sends that changes anything, "phone state: low power mode" (Samsung IPC's power group 0x01, number 0x07,
 *      "execute", the two bytes 01 00: what Android sends for airplane mode), is put in the ring first, then
 *      INIT_END is said (and said again on every PHONE_START until the CP stops repeating it: it looks at the one
 *      message word about every 100 ms, and anything written there sooner replaces INIT_END). The running
 *      CP otherwise goes to its NORMAL state by itself, receiver on, looking for a network (seen on 12 Nov 2026 with
 *      zeros for NV; never again: with zeros or without cp_nv=1 this stage is refused and the run stays at stage
 *      3). The CP is stopped at once if its next "phone state" is not low power, if none comes in 5 s, or if a
 *      registration state other than "none" is ever reported. Everything the CP sends is logged (the channel, the
 *      message's group, number and type, its length; the phone state, the SIM status bytes, the registration state;
 *      a file request's kind, name, offset and length), one harmless question is asked (the modem's software
 *      version) and its answer logged. The CP's file requests are NOT answered and nothing it wants stored is
 *      kept. After cp_wait seconds (25) the CP is put back in reset.
 *
 *   5  that, and, ONLY when the phone's owner has asked for it, the radio: with the CP confirmed in low power mode
 *      and the SIM's status "ready" (0x82 or 0x83; a locked SIM ends the run, no PIN is ever sent), "phone state:
 *      normal" is asked for (the bytes 02 02: what Android sends when airplane mode is switched off). The phone
 *      then registers on its network as it does under Android. Logged: the phone state, every registration state,
 *      the serving network's operator code, the signal words. Two minutes after it has registered (or 90 s after
 *      the request if it has not) low power mode is asked for again, confirmed, and the CP put back in reset.
 *      No call, message, network or band selection is ever asked for; a data session only in stage 6.
 *
 *   6  that, and, ONLY with an access point name given by the builder (cp_apn=NAME: the operator's published default
 *      one; none is built in), a data context: 5 s after the phone has registered the context is defined (Samsung
 *      IPC's packet group 0x0D, number 1, "set": enable, context 1, type 2, the name) and, if the CP's general
 *      response accepts that, activated (number 4, "set": enable, context 1, no user name or password). These are
 *      the layouts of the public numbering for older Samsung modems, NOT confirmed for this one: the CP's answer
 *      to each is the result of the stage, and a refusal ends it (no second form is tried). Logged: each result
 *      word, the packet group's notifications (the call status' bytes; of the address configuration its length,
 *      context and the first octet only), and how many packets the CP put on the data channels (their length and
 *      IP version; nothing is sent on them and none is passed on). 20 s later the context is deactivated, then
 *      low power mode, then reset, as in stage 5.
 *
 *   7  that, and three packets of our own through the context, made and checked in this file (no interface is
 *      made, nothing of the system's is carried): with the context's IPv4 address and first DNS server taken from
 *      the CP's address configuration (kept in memory for the run, never logged beyond one octet), one ICMP echo
 *      request (to cp_ping=A.B.C.D, or to that DNS server) and one DNS question for the A record of example.com go
 *      up, and whatever comes down is checked (lengths, header and data checksums, addresses, the echo's and the
 *      question's identifiers) and counted: answered, not ours, IPv6, malformed. The rings, as Samsung's kernel
 *      uses them on this phone (read as facts): a data packet has no frame header, its channel (10: context 1) is
 *      in the upper half of its ring slot's size word; up through the "data" ring; down either through the "high
 *      priority" ring or, for the "data" ring, into buffers of the 11 MB "ZMC" region behind the IPC memory: the
 *      AP writes each slot's 64-bit data offset (from the IPC memory's start) and moves the ring's read counter
 *      as its offer, the CP fills a buffer, sets the slot's size word and moves the write counter. Here slot k
 *      always has the same 4 KB cell k, the offsets are never read back for use, the CP's counter is checked
 *      against the ring's length and against what was offered, a length over 2048 is a malformed packet, and a
 *      packet is copied out before it is looked at.
 *
 * NEVER DONE HERE: no partition is written; EFS is not read; no request that sets an identity, a band, a power or
 * a calibration value, no test or factory mode, no PIN; the radio is on only in stage 5. An answer that could carry
 * an identity is logged as its length only.
 *
 * kern.hakios.cp.state reads where it got to (the stage reached, 100 + a stage that failed, 200 stopped);
 * kern.hakios.cp.go: 1 the state printed, 2 the CP stopped (reset asserted), 3 the version asked again.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENTS
 *   cp=N         the first N of the Galaxy S9's modem's six stages (1 a look, 2 its image loaded and checked, 3 started, 4 the link, 5 the network, 6 a data context, 7 three packets through it); 0 or none: left alone
 *   cp_sim=1     in low power mode, once the SIM is ready, one read of its administrative data file (EF_AD, 4 bytes: no identity) is asked, to see if the modem takes the public numbering's SIM read (seen twice on an SM-G960F: refused, result 0x8001)
 *   cp_ping=A.B.C.D  the address stage 7 sends its one echo request to (none: the context's first DNS server)
 *   cp_apn=NAME  the access point name stage 6 asks the data context for (the operator's published default; none: no stage 6)
 *   cp_nv=1      the phone's own NV data, a file nv_data.bin the image's builder put beside the kernel, is given to the modem (none: zeros, and no stage 4)
 *   cp_if=1      with cp=6 or 7 and cp_apn: the active data context becomes a network interface, pdp_ip0 (IPv4, point to point, the CP's address for it), and stays up: no deactivation, no return to low power, no two-minute limit; the modem runs until kern.hakios.cp.go=2. Off: the stages end as before
 *   cp_if_kb=N   with cp_if=1: at most N KB through pdp_ip0 in a boot, both ways (2048 by default; the owner's mobile plan), then it drops
 *   cp_route=1   with cp_if=1: an IPv4 default route through pdp_ip0 (only when there is none yet: Wi-Fi's wins)
 *   cp_nv=2      the phone's own NV data read at boot from the EFS partition (/nv_data.bin, read-only, never mounted, never written), kept in RAM only; the CP's file requests for it (RFS NV read/write) are answered from that copy and its writes kept there for the run, never written back
 *   cp_rfs=1     with cp_nv=2: the CP's file opens (RFS command 0x11, e.g. CP_OMC_AUDIO_SLSI.bin) answered "not there" (handle -1,
 *                ENOENT) from RAM; nothing is read or opened. Off: they stay unanswered
 *   cp_vss=0     the image's VSS part (the voice processor's) is not copied
 *   cp_rev=N     the board's revision told to the modem (26, this phone's)
 *   cp_ds=N      the dual SIM field told to the modem (0)
 *   cp_wait=N    seconds the started modem is watched before it is put back in reset (20; 25 with the link)
 *   cp_delay=N   seconds after the boot before the modem's driver does anything (30), so that its lines are in the log
 *
 * WHERE IT MAY RUN. The CP's memory is fixed by the boot chain at 0xF0000000. On a tree whose loader puts XNU itself
 * there (the 16.5 line's UEFI does: devices/starlte/docs/modem-plan.md, 1.5) this driver must not load anything: it
 * checks that no page of the 146 MB is XNU's and that the kernel is not in it, and does nothing if either fails.
